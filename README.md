# Introduction to `ipcwQR` package


# Introduction
`ipcwQR` is the R package to fit the linear quantile regressions when the data are partially interval-censored and possibly correlated within same cluster.
Let $T$ and $X$ be the event time of interest and its related $p$-vector of covariates, respectively.
Our main objective is to estimate 
the $p$-dimensional quantile coefficient vector ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}_0(\tau)$
for some $\tau \in[\tau_L,\tau_R]\subset (0, 1)$ 
in the following linear quantile regression model:
$$
T_i = {\bf x}_i^T {\boldsymbol{\beta}}_0(\tau) + e_i(\tau),\quad i=1, \ldots ,n, 
$$
where $e_i(\tau)$ is the random error 
whose $\tau$th quantile conditional on ${\bf x}_i$ equals 0. 
When the data are subject to partially interval-censoring, 
left and right endpoints of the censoring time, $L$ and $R$,
are observed instead of $T$ such that $T\in(L,R)$.
Note that double-censoring  can also  be viewed as 
a special case of partly interval-censoring, 
i.e., $T$ is left-censored if $L=0$ and right-censored if $R=\infty$.
